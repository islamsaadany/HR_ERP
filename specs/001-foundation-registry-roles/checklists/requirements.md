# Specification Quality Checklist: Foundation — Employee Registry & Roles

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — 2 open (FR-022 tenure bands, FR-023 employee self-edit scope)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Two clarifications remain (tenure band set; employee self-edit scope). Both are genuine
  open decisions surfaced to the user — resolve via `/speckit-clarify` before `/speckit-plan`.
- Tenure-band set is coupled to the real Benefits figures, which arrive later; it can be
  provisionally answered to unblock Foundation planning.
